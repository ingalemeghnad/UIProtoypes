Here is a clean reusable prompt summarizing everything we have discussed so far.
You can copy-paste this anytime to regenerate the same design direction, landing page, tiles, and behavior.

✅ Reusable Prompt for Later Use

**“I am designing a centralized payments UI called Global Payments Console (GPC). It will be a single unified console for payment operations and payment administration. The platform should support role-based tiles with SSO login. Typical users are Payment Ops and Payment Admin teams. Core functions include:
	•	Payment search & inquiry (InstrId / EndToEndId / MsgId / ISO20022 attributes)
	•	Payment cancellation (maker–checker), payment return (maker–checker)
	•	Bulk cancellation & bulk return
	•	Validation rules engine / POM rules editor (ISO20022-aware conditions)
	•	Reference data management (currency lists, BIC, static data)
	•	HV engine configuration
	•	Instant payments configuration
	•	SEPA engine configuration
	•	CREST operations (separate tile)
	•	Partner bank configuration (separate tile)
	•	Role-based tiles
	•	SSO auto-login into console
	•	No compliance or audit section needed

I want:
	1.	A clean landing page for GPC explaining key capabilities and use cases.
	2.	A “Launch GPC” button that simulates SSO and opens the console.
	3.	A console layout with sidebar + top bar + tile grid (as per earlier prototype).
	4.	Tiles should open modal UIs for each function with assumed ISO fields.
	5.	Remove audit/compliance references and remove logo section.

Generate a single-page HTML/CSS application implementing this behavior (landing + console + tiles + modal screens). Keep the styling modern and consistent with the earlier prototypes.”**

If you want, I can also produce a shorter version, a version for management pitch, or a version for Jira/Epics documentation.
